        This has an impact on versioning in the main branch.
        Note that the current CI workflow will bump the version in
        the main branch _after_the merged balenaCloud release has
        been deployed as final.
        As such, breaking changes may be introduced in `x.y.z-rev`
        releases in the balenaCloud dashboard with no indication
        that the major version was bumped as part of the same merge.
        However each balenaCloud release version (draft or final)
        will be tagged on the associated git commit so that should
        be used as the source of truth.
