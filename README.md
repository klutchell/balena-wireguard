| `PEERS`       | Number of peers to create confs for. Can be a number like `4` or a list of names such as `myPC,myPhone,myTablet`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `PEER_DNS`    | DNS server set in peer/client configs. Defaults to `1.1.1.1`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| `ALLOWEDIPS`  | The IPs/Ranges that the peers will be able to reach using the VPN connection. If not specified the default value is `0.0.0.0/0, ::0/0`. This will cause ALL traffic to route through the VPN, if you want split tunneling, set this to only the IPs you would like to use the tunnel AND the ip of the server's WG ip, such as 10.13.13.1. |

## Usage/Examples

Once your device joins the fleet you'll need to allow some time for it to download the application and start the services.

When it's done you can display QR codes for each peer by running `show-peer <peer>` in the container shell.

For example, the following CLI command will show the QR code for `myPhone`:

`echo "show-peer myPhone; exit;" | balena ssh <UUID> wireguard`
